Textual content in the home page and throughout the site needs yto be checked for correctness. ,PMC,July
The app should have information buttons for content where it is not clear to the user on what the variable means. Some examples of these are the climate change scenario and the conservation status of species.,PMC,July
Users should be given more context about what national and regional conservaton status means,PMC,July

Is it possible to give the user better locational context through the use of district/province borders?,PMC,May
