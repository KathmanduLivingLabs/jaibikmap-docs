About the project
-----------------

**Jaibik Map is a first of its kind, open-source biodiversity mapping and visualization tool in Nepal.**

With the overarching goal of creating a platform which liberates data and amplifies potential for citizen-centred data acquisition, the Jaibik Map project seeks to answer two mutually-reinforcing research objectives, the former being a development question and the latter a scientific one:

 - How can we enable and inspire conservation advances by lifting the existing barriers in data science and capacitating emerging researchers (from government ministries to citizen scientists)?

- How can ICT tools be applied to cutting-edge research questions to not only provide a proof of concept for emerging, innovative mapping tools, but also inform conservation and development planning?


Project objectives
------------------

The Jaibik Map Project seeks to achieve the following outcomes upon the project's completion

 - Establish a visual representation of mammalian species abundance, status, distribution and habitat requirements for all 208 mammal species occurring in Nepal; and overlay this data against location/distribution of existing land use and habitat, settlements and roads.

 - Model changes in Nepal’s forest cover, composition and distribution in light of various future climate change (emissions) scenarios. Conduct innovative species distribution modelling based on the results. Build capacity at all levels for the model’s uptake and general conservation.

 -Incorporating all of the aforementioned data (Objectives 1 and 2), develop an interactive, slippy (with zooming capability), open data web-based map and associated Android Phone application to enable the public to submit opportunistic photographs of mammal sightings to the JaibikMap. Disseminate the product and train stakeholders in its use, and provide protocols among stakeholders for its continual application.

 - Ensure the project translates to impacts on USAID development objectives through capacity development, information dissemination/integration, and sustainability measures.
